## Hi, I'm Leo 👋



I’m a 4th-year Computer Sopftware Engineering Co-op Student at the University of Alberta with a passion for technology and innovation. Whether it’s tinkering with microcontrollers, building machine learning models to analyze data, or experimenting with laser cutting and 3D printing, I thrive on learning something new every day. I enjoy connecting and exchanging ideas with people from all backgrounds.

Feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat!
