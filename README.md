## Hi, I'm Leo ðŸ‘‹



Iâ€™m a 4th-year Computer Engineering Co-op Student at the University of Alberta with a passion for technology and innovation. Whether itâ€™s tinkering with microcontrollers, building machine learning models to analyze data, or experimenting with laser cutting and 3D printing, I thrive on learning and creating something new every day.

Currently, Iâ€™m developing an embedded system for a total artificial heart with the team at Alberta Hearts. Iâ€™m also looking forward to continuing my co-op journey in Summer 2025, where I hope to tackle exciting challenges and grow as an engineer.

I enjoy connecting and exchanging ideas with people from all backgrounds. Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to chat!
