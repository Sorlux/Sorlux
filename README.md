Iâ€™m a 4th-year Computer Sopftware Engineering Co-op Student at the University of Alberta with a passion for technology and innovation. Whether itâ€™s tinkering with microcontrollers, building machine learning models to analyze data, or experimenting with laser cutting and 3D printing, I thrive on learning something new every day. I enjoy connecting and exchanging ideas with people from all backgrounds.

Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to chat!
